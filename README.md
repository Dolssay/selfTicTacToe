# selfTicTacToe
 A simple game of Tic Tac Toe

 It's my first learning experience writing code on my own
 
 Run the ProjectRunner file in the src folder and you are good to go!
 
 This is a 2 players game, where players take turn mark down X or O on a 3x3
 grid, whoever gets 3 of their marks in a row first win.
